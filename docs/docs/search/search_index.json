Please contact the open-water testing support team at NREL for more information. Contact Us</p> <p>NREL's first generation MODAQ (Modular Open-source Data AcQuisition) is a highly performant, capable, and extensible platform for data acquisition, control, and automation that is based on the National Instruments cRIO controller line and family of expansion chassis and I/O modules. While MODAQ v1.0 (M1, hereafter) has proven itself in both the field and laboratory, several factors have indicated the need for additional solutions that were not well served on the M1 architecture, which led to the development of MODAQ 2 (M2). M2 is an approach based on generally available hardware and open-source development tools. </p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Before diving too deeply into the details, it's important to understand the motivation behind M2. There were several reasons, but they all boil down to either: </p> <ol> <li>We did not have a solution that satisfied particular project requirements, or</li> <li>Feedback from customers and partners </li> </ol> <p>In the case of #1, projects may have power or physical limitations that simply could not be met with any cRIO-based M1 variant. What was often the case is that we needed a solution that could be powered by batteries or otherwise have low power consumption. While our go-to cRIO (9049) in M1 is relatively power efficient (60W at maximum load), it's not practical for battery or power constrained applications. And despite its compactness, it can be too big (and heavy) for some use cases. Further, a cRIO was often overkill for some applications. While the cRIO scales up nicely, it does not scale well in the other direction. </p> <p>With regards to feedback from the companies and organizations we frequently work with, there's often resistance to the M1 platform based on system cost or universality of the software development language- or both. </p> <p>National Instruments publishes the price of its hardware on their website without the dreaded \"Click for Quote\" obfuscation, so it's easy to get an idea of the price range for the controller and I/O modules. With strained budgets and an eye toward the future, where an organization may be considering arrays of devices or multiple device variants, it can be questionable if the M1 platform is a good fit, particularly when considering a pivot to production. </p> <p>Then there's the concern about the development language. M1 is written in LabVIEW, which is National Instruments' proprietary programming language. Here the issues are mostly around subscription costs and availability of LabVIEW developers. There's no sugar-coating that annual subscription costs for a LabVIEW Professional seat can be eye-opening- especially after bundling the Real-Time and FPGA modules. </p> <p>Aside from the cost, availability of skilled LabVIEW developers pales in comparison to that of languages such as Python or C/C++. LabVIEW does not even appear in popular development language rankings. While it might not be fair to compare LabVIEW to general-purpose languages - and it's probably fairer to compare it to industrial programming languages such as those used for PLC or other vendor-specific packages - the fact remains that LabVIEW is rather niche and there's not an abundance of well-rounded engineers that just happen to be competent in LabVIEW in the job market. </p> <p>The intent here is not to bash on NI or LabVIEW, but rather to point out some of the challenges involved when collaborating with commercial enterprises- and even academia to some degree. We use NI and LabVIEW extensively at NREL and appreciate how it enables rapid development of data acquisition and control systems, complete with graphical user interfaces, for test setups. Some of us have experience in this ecosystem dating back to the 1900's! </p>"},{"location":"#m2-goals-and-design-requirements","title":"M2 Goals and Design Requirements","text":"<p>There is little point to developing a new system without first establishing some overarching goals.

The Configurator will warn the user if they attempt to add more values than the parameter supports in the Message Box.</p> Q&amp;A <p>Q: Why can't I add a new parameter to a node?  A: The C++ code for a node must be specifically written to accept configurable values at launch. All such configurable values for a node are already presented when a node is added to the configuration.<p> Q: What happen with M2 if I deleted a parameter, will it still work? A: Depending on which parameter was deleted there may be no noticeable impact to the operation of M2. This is because all configurable parameters are hard-coded with default values that are used if values are not passed in at launch. However, those default values may cause undesirable behavior if a parameter is missing such as with email addresses or file paths.<p> Q: How do I get a parameter back if I accidentally delete it? A: At this time, there is no direct way to insert a parameter- maybe in a future release. However as a workaround, delete the entire node from the node listbox and add the node back again. Any previous edits on the deleted node will be lost, but the deleted parameter will now be available. <p> Q: I renamed a node and it does not work when I launch the M2 code A: Node names in the configurator must match their launch names in the M2 code see: Link.  </p>"},{"location":"configurator/#saving-a-configuration","title":"Saving a Configuration","text":"<p>The edited configuration can be saved to a file by selecting the Write to File button.

For example, while renaming nodes is allowed, the new name must match the node name assigned to the node in the M2 launch file (<code>m2_launch.py</code>) settings- otherwise the renamed node will be ignored when M2 launches. A node can be given any name in the launch file as long as it meets syntax requirements and is unique. Therefore, when it comes to renaming nodes, it may be necessary to also change the name (manually) in the launch file too. </p> <p>Similarly, the file name given to the configuration file must agree with the filename specified in the launch file. </p> <p>The C++ language that M2 is written in is a strictly-typed language and in such, if a node expects an integer datatype for a configurable value, yet a float datatype is provided from the configuration file, that node will issue an error and fail to launch.

In some cases, the Configurator will attempt to coerce the input to the correct datatype, but sometimes this is not possible (see Known Issues).

At this point, the libraries appear to be sufficiently stable and since the HMI is served on a private subnet, security should not be an issue.

It used to be a given that a library would have a simple and clear link to the offline version, but that is slowly changing. Since most web servers are by nature 'online', it makes sense to pull the libraries as needed from a CDN which should assure the libraries are up to date, with all recent bugfixes and security patches. This is also smart from a marketing/tracking perspective, since the developer can have a better feel for the userbase and popularity of their scripts. However, CDNs can go down, scripts can be moved to different CDNs, developers can pull/change features or alter the licensing terms, or there can be network issues causing the script not to load, so for mission critical stuff and particularly if this server does not have continuous internet access, an offline version is necessary</p>"},{"location":"hmi/#nginx-configuration","title":"nginx Configuration","text":"<p>nginx can be install with the following terminal command:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install nginx\n</code></pre> <p>Configuration of nginx will live in these folders:</p> <pre><code>/etc/nginx/sites-available\n</code></pre> <pre><code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n</code></pre> <p>The website (HMI) is hosted from the <code>/var/www/</code> folder by default.

Because of this complexity, this section will not go into detail on its use, but will point out a few details around getting the streaming to work correctly - particularly with multivariate/dual-axis plots. </p> <p>chart.js, without the <code>chartjs-plugin-streaming</code> plugin, expects to be passed a static numeric array and it renders into a plot with the selected attributes. The streaming plugin (basically) creates a fifo buffer for the data points and animates them on the x-axis.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>limit the chart history in order to assure smooth operation- especially with multiple charts on a single HMI page.</p> <p>The architecture of the HMI web stack purposely places the computational burden of chart composition and rendering on the web client (i.e. your browser) not the M2 controller. Therefore, low-powered computers may struggle with smooth animation if the HMI has a lot of plots and/or the chart history is too big. The example included in this repo updates the chart at 1 Hz and displays up to 1 minute of data history. The update rate and history depth can be adjusted to preference.</p> <p>chart.js breaks up the chart composition into 3 blocks: setup, config, and render. The setup block defines the y-axis datasets, labels, and plot trace attributes. The config block expands on this by defining additional attributes and binding the dataset(s) to an object that gets rendered in the render block. This all expects the data to formatted as an array, however our data are constructed into objects. </p> <p>To overcome this, we define a object literal to map the y-axis label(s) to the label used to identify the desired element in the data object (example for the accelerometer data). </p> <p><pre><code>const dataMap = { Ax: 'ax', Ay: 'ay', Az: 'az' };\n</code></pre> Then we insert each data point into the chart object:</p> <pre><code>chart.data.datasets.forEach(dataset =&gt; {\n    dataset.data.push({\n        x: Date.now(),\n        y: mpu6050_data[dataMap[dataset.label]],\n    });\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Side Note - We typically use high quality inertial sensors in our projects and eagle-eyed readers will notice the MPU-6050 referenced in a few places in this documentation and the github repo. The MPU-6050 is a &lt;$5 sensor that has some utility in the occasional low-cost/low demand applications (see: MODAQ-BB). </p> <p>Similarly, handling a multivariate data object and plotting with dual y-axes took some creativity, but is simpler as long as only 2 parameters are plotted:</p> <pre><code>chart.data.datasets.forEach(dataset =&gt; {\n    dataset.data.push({\n        x: Date.now(),\n        y: dataset.label === 'Temperature' ? ths_data.temperature : ths_data.humidity\n    });\n});\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Using the minified version of any of the required JS libraries is totally optional.

With fast, multi-core processors, these appear to be seamlessly juggled, usually with little delay apparent to the user. This is all managed by the scheduler and it tries to be fair as it doles out access to a CPU core. Under critical analysis, an application may have to wait a non-deterministic amount of time for that CPU attention- and that wait time might vary considerably for each request.
